                    Sometimes great things come from humble beginnings. For Merilee
                    Wilbur, that beginning came in the form of a request from her 8-year-old son, Jake, who needed a
                    snack to take to his chess club meeting. Merilee flipped through her recipe box and pulled out her
                    grandmother's recipe for Chess Pie. Perfect!
                </p>

                <p>The pie was such a hit with the kids - and their coach - that Merilee started getting requests to
                    bake pies for other occasions: school events, birthdays, even a Pi Day celebration at the local
                    library. Pie in the Sky Bakery was born.</p>

                <p>She got so many orders that her fledgling business soon outgrew her family's kitchen. In 2006, she
                    rented her current location at 34 Main Street, where she and her team of bakers have served up
                    fresh, delicious pies ever since.</p>

                        <p>Merilee sure knows how to bake! Not a week goes by that I don't stop in for a slice of her
                            cherry pie. They truly are just like Mother used to make.</p>
